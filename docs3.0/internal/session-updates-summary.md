# Session and UI State Management Updates - Evening of Oct 5, 2025

## 1. Overview

This document summarizes a series of critical bug fixes and improvements made to the application's UI state management, backend stability, and role-based permissions. The core focus was resolving issues related to stale data in the frontend, which caused a disconnected user experience, particularly for the **Cashier** and **Kitchen** roles.

## 2. Key Issues Addressed

### 2.1. Stale UI State After Mutations

- **Problem**: The UI was not updating automatically after key actions like opening/closing a cash session or creating a sale. This was due to aggressive global caching (`staleTime: Infinity`) in the React Query client, which prevented components from refetching fresh data even after it was invalidated.
- **Solution**:
  - **Forceful Refetching**: Implemented an `invalidateQueries` followed by an explicit `refetchQueries` pattern in the `onSuccess` handlers for all relevant mutations.
  - **`staleTime: 0`**: Applied `staleTime: 0` to `useQuery` hooks on pages that needed to display real-time data, ensuring they would always refetch when invalidated or when the component re-mounted.
  - **`refreshKey` Strategy**: On the `Sessions` page, a `refreshKey` state was added to the `queryKey` to programmatically force a refetch and re-render, providing a robust solution to the stubborn caching.
- **Affected Files**: `client/src/pages/sessions.tsx`, `client/src/pages/sales.tsx`, `client/src/pages/kitchen.tsx`.

### 2.2. Backend Server Crash on Insufficient Inventory

- **Problem**: The backend server would crash with an unhandled error if a user tried to open a cash session with more inventory than was available in the main stock.
- **Solution**:
  - **Graceful Error Handling**: The `POST /api/sessions/open` route was updated to include a `try...catch` block that specifically handles the "Insufficient inventory" error. Instead of crashing, the server now returns a `400 Bad Request` with a clear error message.
  - **Frontend Toast Notification**: The `onError` handler for the `openSessionMutation` was updated to display a user-friendly toast message when this specific error occurs.
- **Affected Files**: `server/routes.ts`, `client/src/pages/sessions.tsx`.

### 2.3. Incorrect Role-Based Access and Permissions

- **Problem**:
  1.  The **Admin** user's navigation bar was cluttered with links irrelevant to their role (e.g., "Point of Sale").
  2.  The newly created **Dev** user had no access to any pages.
  3.  The **Kitchen** user was encountering `403 Forbidden` errors when accessing necessary data.
- **Solution**:
  - **Admin Nav Cleanup**: Removed the `ADMIN` role from the "Point of Sale" and "Cash Sessions" navigation links in the `Layout.tsx` component.
  - **Dev User Full Access**: Added the `DEV` role to every navigation item in `Layout.tsx` to provide universal access. A new dev user was also added to the `seed.ts` file.
  - **Kitchen Permissions**: Granted the `KITCHEN` role access to the `/api/raw-materials` and `/api/stock/low` endpoints in `server/routes.ts`.
- **Affected Files**: `client/src/components/Layout.tsx`, `server/seed.ts`, `server/routes.ts`.

## 3. Final State

The application is now significantly more stable and provides a smoother, more intuitive user experience. The separation of roles is clearer, and the system is more resilient to errors.
